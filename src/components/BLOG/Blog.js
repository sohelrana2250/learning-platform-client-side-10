                                        Node. js is a JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. In other words, Node. js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return.

                                        <Card.Text>It is a used as backend service where javascript works on the server-side of the application. This way javascript is used on both frontend and backend. Node. js runs on chrome v8 engine which converts javascript code into machine code, it is highly scalable, lightweight, fast, and data-intensive. Working of Node.Node is completely event-driven. Basically the server consists of one thread processing one event after another. A new request coming in is one kind of event. The server starts processing it and when there is a blocking IO operation, it does not wait until it completes and instead registers a callback function.</Card.Text>

                                        CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing . It allows us to relax the security applied to an API. This is done by bypassing the Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers, which specify which origins can access the API.

                                        <Card.Text>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing CORS is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins domain, scheme, or port other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.Run the server with npm nodemon . Navigate to http://localhost:6069/ingredients on your browser. You will be served with these ingredients text items. In this example, cross-origin is allowed because you're currently on the same domain, and you are executing this request from the same domain.</Card.Text>

                                        Use useRef if you need to manage focus, text selection, trigger imperative animations or integrating third-party libraries.

                                        useRef returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument  initialValue. The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component. Essentially, useRef is like a “box” that can hold a mutable value in its .current property.

                                        useRef can be used to store local mutable value in a component. It doesn't participate in rerendering (unline state data). useMemo is used to memoize (like we do in Dynamic Programming, concept wise) and skip recalculation.
